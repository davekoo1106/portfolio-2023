                <p>The goal of this project was to create an app. As a team we agreed that we would come up with a retail app that focused on sustainability, allowing the consumer to find vintage, new or even items owned by community members. 
                I facilitated the UI/UX creating the hi fideility wireframes and the prototyping. Focusing a great amount of time on user focused design.</p>

Each year, there are over 100 billion garments produced, 92 million tonnes end up in the landfill to be disposed of.</p>

                <p>Once the wireframes were done by my designer, we got together to work on the hi fidelity wireframes and the prototyping</p>
                <p>Once the initial hi fidelity wireframes were finished, the team collaborated to make sure that it was up to standard.</p>
                <p>The prototypes and the hi fidelity wireframes were done with making the process as simple as possible. We wanted to make sure that the user would know what they were looking at and what would come next, with minimal distractions. Focusing on the customer being able to complete there transaction.</p>
                <p>Prior to creating the wireframes, research was done on competitive apps (Poshmark, Vinted, Grailed). Through research we found that they had one thing that they all offered, the ability to quickly upload items. This was down by adding it to the bottom nav bar. Therefore, we incorporated into our design which would allow the user to upload items with ease.</p>

                <h3 class="highlight">User Testing</h3>
                <p>Since this project strictly focused on completing a project using the waterfall methodology with the use of a project management tool, the next step would be to test the prototype on users. Is it easy enough for users to use? Are there more features that they want to see? Any changes that they would like to see? Those would all be questions that would further the process of the app</p>

                <p>Users would be able to message each other in regards to trades or buying second hand items. It would cause us to think how the page would look like as well as the user experience i.e how can we make it so that users can message each other easily and have a good experience? </p>
