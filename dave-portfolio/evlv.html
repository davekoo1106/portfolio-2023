            <div class="project-items">
                <p>The goal of this project was to create a retail app that focused on a specific user flow. For this project I chose the login/signup user flow, focusing a great amount of time on making sure users would be able to login and create an account with ease. Also, making sure that once the user is logged in, they would be able to easily find their way around account settings such as adding a credit card or deleting a credit card.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li> - Rewards: Rewarding users with points each purchase that can be used towards a discount on their next purchase</li>
                    <li> - In app points: Users would be able to purchase items with points they earn</li>

                <p>I started off the design process by visualizing the number of steps a user takes to complete an expected task on the app, identifying how the average user navigates through the app. The user flow will give an understanding of how to map out the screens, as well as what the most optimal flow is</p>

                <p>Once the initial low fidelity wireframes were finished, I started brainstorming on what I could do during the prototypes to ensure that it would be a smooth experience</p>
                <p>The prototype was created in a way where the user would have the easiest time logging in and creating an account</p>
                <p>I was also tasked with creating user settings where the user would be able to change settings within their profile</p>
                <p>Alterations such as being able to change their payment method, add a card, remove a card, or change the email address associated with the account</p>

                <h2>Revisions</h2> 
                <p>Initially, I had created the project as a mobile interface. I decided to change it as a mobile app. The biggest difference between prototypes is the bottom tab bar. In the mobile app prototype, a nav bar has been added for convenience so that the user would be able to quickly navigate between tabs compared to the mobile interface where the footer was in place of the tab bar</p>

                <h2 class="highlight">Website landing page</h2>
                <p>Since this project strictly focused on creating an app for the mobile device, the next step would be to design and devlop a working landing page on desktop to see how it looks and how users would interact with it.</p>

            <div class="strategy-content">
                <h2 class="highlight">Building out a shopping page</h2>
                <p>To integrate further development towards the app would be to include a fully functional shopping page, where it would display items based on categories such as mens, womens, accessories and other items that a user would potentially be interested in. However, given the time frame of this project, I was not able to fully build it out</p>
            </div>
            <div class="strategy-content">
                <h2 class="highlight">Rewards program</h2>
                <p>A key feature that I would like to incorporate within this project is the rewards program. Users would be able to track how many points they have and how much further until they reach a discount or special offer. For example, if a user were to successfully reach 150 points, they would get 20% off there next instore or online purchase. Some questions to think about are: how would the reward system interface look like? Would it be a badge? or would it be a ring where everytime they earn a point it fills up the ring?</p>
